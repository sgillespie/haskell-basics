> An advanced, purely functional programming language

---

Features

 * Purely Functional
 * Lazy Evaluation
 * Statically Typed
 * Type Inference

## History

---

There were many purely functional languages in the late 80's.

---

There was a need for an open standard that would

 * Combine features of existing languages.
 * Serve as a basis for research in functional language design.

## Functional Programming

---

Functions are First-class Values

 * Functions can be passed to functions
 * Functions can be returned from functions

---

Mutating Global State is Discouraged

 * Pure functions are predictable
 * Pure functions can be optimized

# Haskell Use Cases

---

Advantages

 * Type safety / correctness
 * Compilers, interpreters, parsers
 * Programming language research

---

Haskell Disadvantages

 * Steep learning curve
 * Extensions frequently change
 * Performance can be unpredictable

---
